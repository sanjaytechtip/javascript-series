- Getters and Setters allow you to define object properties that behave like methods but are accessed like regular properties.
- Getters are used to access the value of an object's property, and setters are used to modify or set the value.

#Getters
- A getter allows you to define a method that is called when an object property is accessed. It does not require parentheses when called.

#Setters
- A setter allows you to define a method that is called when an object property is assigned a value.

Why Use Getters and Setters?

* Encapsulation: They help control how properties are accessed and modified, keeping object internals safe.
* Validation: Setters can validate values before updating them, ensuring that the data remains consistent.
* Computed Properties: Getters can compute values dynamically based on other properties.

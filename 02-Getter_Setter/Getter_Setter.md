- Getters and Setters allow you to define object properties that behave like methods but are accessed like regular properties.
- Getters are used to access the value of an object's property, and setters are used to modify or set the value.

#Getter
- A getter allows you to define a method that is called when an object property is accessed. It does not require parentheses when called.
